# House-Prices-Prediction-using-Different-Types-of-Regression-Techniques

This is a Machine Learning based project, where house prices are predicted based on 81 features given in the dataset. I used two regression techniques to compare which regression technique gives better results.

> Training set had 81 features and 1460 records.

> Using high correlation, we eliminated 70 features.

> As a result, only 10 features remained.
